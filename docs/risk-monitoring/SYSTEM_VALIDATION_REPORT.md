### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

#### 1. Big Tech Monitor - Mitigation Actions (Minor Issue)
**Issue**: `test_mitigation_actions_generation` failed
```
AssertionError: False is not true
```
**Impact**: Low - Core monitoring works, action generation logic needs refinement
**Fix Required**: Adjust mitigation action ID generation logic

#### 2. Regulatory Monitor - Module Import (Technical Issue)
**Issue**: `test_compliance_gap_identification` error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'regulatory_monitor'
```
**Impact**: Low - Import issue in test, not production code
**Fix Required**: Update test import mechanism

#### 3. Early Warning System - Trigger Processing (Minor Issue)
**Issue**: `test_trigger_event_processing` failed
```
AssertionError: unexpectedly None
```
**Impact**: Low - Alert creation works, trigger processing needs validation
**Fix Required**: Verify async trigger event handling

#### 4. Error Handling - Configuration Path (Edge Case)
**Issue**: `test_invalid_config_handling` failed
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/non'
```
**Impact**: Low - Edge case with invalid paths
**Fix Required**: Improve error handling for invalid configuration paths

### üìß External Service Integration Notes

**Email and Slack Alerts**: Expected failures due to test environment
- Error messages indicate authentication failures (expected in test environment)
- Alerts are being created successfully in the system
- Production deployment will require proper SMTP and Slack credentials

```
ERROR: Failed to send email alert: Username and Password not accepted
ERROR: Failed to send Slack alert: 404
INFO: Alert created successfully
```
